Hello! I'm Mike, a software engineer with over 6 years of experience specializing in building data-driven products for platform companies.

With a background in economics and analytics, I'm just as comfortable analyzing data in Python with a Jupyter Notebook as I am building a real time analytics service in Java. I enjoy solving problems on small, independent, and focused teams.

I have over four years of experience performing [Improv Comedy](http://http://www.improvboston.com/), and I bring the active listening and open-mindedness skills it requires to the workplace!

I'm currently working on creating a first-class experience for developers building on top of [HubSpot's](https://www.hubspot.com/) platform. Focused on Webhooks, API Metrics, and Rate Limiting at scale.
